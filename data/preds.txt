['Certain aspects of TCR responses such as the induction of transcriptional activity of AP1 and serum response factor were not affected by expression of the mutant forms of PI 3-kinase.', 'Stimulation of transcriptional activity by agonistic anti-CD28 antibodies in conjunction with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulation was totally inhibited by dexamethasone.']

['and ETS-like motifs have been identified in the promoter region of the GM-CSF gene, which are important for transcriptional activity following PMA and ionomycin stimulation.']
